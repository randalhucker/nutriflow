# Quickstart

This is the fastest way to get value from NutriFlow.

## 1) Create or Join a Household (Optional)
If you plan with others, set up a household:
- Create a household
- Invite members
- Choose who can modify pantry/cart

See: [Households](../guides/households.md)

## 2) Favorite Foods and Ingredients (Your building blocks)
Favorite the ingredients you commonly eat (e.g., “Greek Yogurt 0%”, “Chicken Breast”) and create custom Food items for things we don't quite have yet.
See: [Foods](../guides/food.md)

## 3) Create Meals
Meals are combinations of foods and/or ingredients (they optionally have recipes as well).
See: [Meals](../guides/meals.md)

## 4) Create a Meal Plan
Schedule meals into a plan for a date range.
See: [Meal Plans](../guides/meal-plans.md)

## 5) Scan your pantry/fridge
Use your phone camera to take a picture of where you store your food to help give us an idea of what you currently have in stock!
See: TBD (feature is post-MVP)

## 5) Generate a Cart from the Meal Plan
NutriFlow can populate a shopping cart based on planned meals and pantry contents.
See: [Cart](../guides/cart.md) and [Pantry](../guides/pantry.md)

## 6) Track Intake
Log what you actually ate each day to track macros/calories.
See: [Intake Log](../guides/intake-log.md)
