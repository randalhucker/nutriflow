# Troubleshooting

## I can’t log in / I forgot my password
- Check your email and password
- Password reset flow is TBD

## Search returns no results
- Try fewer keywords
- Confirm you’re searching the correct type (Food vs Ingredient vs Recipe)
- Filters may be too restrictive (TBD)

## Cart doesn’t match my meal plan
- Make sure the correct meal plan is active
- Confirm the date range is correct
- Pantry subtraction may remove items you expected to buy (check pantry inventory)

## Nutrition totals look wrong
- Verify serving sizes
- Verify units (g/ml/oz/unit)
- Confirm you entered quantities correctly
- If using recipe servings, confirm servings are set correctly

## Receipt import failed
- Ensure the image is readable (good lighting, flat receipt)
- Confirm supported store formats (TBD)
- Check receipt import status: uploaded/parsed/applied/error

## Household member can’t edit pantry/cart
- Admin should check role + permission toggles:
  - can_modify_cart
  - can_modify_pantry

## Report a bug / request a feature
- File an issue in the repo: **TBD link/location**
- Include:
  - steps to reproduce
  - expected vs actual result
  - screenshots/logs if available
