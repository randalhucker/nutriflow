# Visibility & Sharing

NutriFlow supports visibility levels for user-created objects (Foods, Meals, Recipes):
- **Private**: only you
- **Household**: visible to household members
- **Public**: visible to all users (TBD)

## When to use each level
- Private: personal items or experiments
- Household: shared staples and shared meal planning
- Public: community contributions (if enabled)

## Changes to visibility
Behavior is TBD:
- Whether existing references (meal plans, logs) are affected
- Whether public objects can be edited by anyone or only the owner
