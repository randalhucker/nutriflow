# Intake Log

The Intake Log tracks what you actually eat each day so you can monitor:
- Calories
- Macros (protein/carbs/fat)
- Optional: fiber, sugar, micronutrients

An intake log entry can include:
- Foods + quantities
- Ingredients + quantities (optional)
- A Meal reference (optional)

## Log intake (Daily)
1. Go to **Intake Log**
2. Select a date
3. Add an item:
   - Choose Food/Ingredient/Meal
   - Set quantity
   - Optionally add metadata (time of day, note)
4. Save

## Notes on accuracy
- For best results, use weights (grams) where possible.

  - serving sizes
  - unit conversions
