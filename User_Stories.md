# User Stories - NutriFlow

- As a household cook, I want to build a weekly meal plan from recipes and foods so that I can hit my nutrition targets without overthinking each day.
- As a grocery shopper, I want NutriFlow to auto-create my cart from the plan and compare prices across nearby stores so that I spend less time shopping and save money.
- As a household "admin", I want to manage our shared pantry and set edit permissions so that we reduce duplicates, avoid waste, and keep everyone on the same page.
- As a user with dietary restrictions, I want to filter and substitute ingredients based on my allergens and diet so that I can cook safely and still enjoy variety.
- As a fitness-focused user, I want to log meals and see macro roll-ups against daily targets so that I can adjust portions and stay on track.
