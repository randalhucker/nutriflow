# NutriFlow - User Stories (Assignment #4)

- As a household cook, I want to build a weekly meal plan from recipes and foods so that I can hit my nutrition targets without overthinking each day.
- As a grocery shopper, I want NutriFlow to auto-create my cart from my meal plan and compare prices across nearby stores so that I spend less time shopping and save money.
- As a parent/member of my household, I want to manage our shared pantry so that we can know what we have, avoid food waste, and keep everyone on the same page.
- As a user with dietary restrictions, I want to filter and substitute ingredients in my meal plan based on my allergens and preferences so that I can cook safely and still enjoy variety.
- As a fitness-focused user, I want to log meals and see macro roll-ups against daily targets so that I can adjust portions and stay on track to meet my goals.
- As an aspiring foodie, I want to explore different recipes and meal suggestions based on my diet so that I can broaden my horizons and find new favorites.
