# Budget

## 1. Summary of Expenses to Date

As of the completion of this Fall Design Report, **no monetary expenses have been incurred** by the NutriFlow team. All work—including architectural design, data modeling, UI/UX sketches, and backend prototyping—has been developed using:

- Personal laptops and existing developer tools  
- Open-source software (Python, React, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, Django/FastAPI, Cypress, etc.)  
- University-provided access to internet, and academic software  

This approach aligns with the economic constraints described in the Project Constraints Essay, emphasizing a self-funded, two-person effort that prioritizes open-source and low-cost solutions.

## 2. Donated Items and Estimated Value
Although no direct spending has occurred, several resources have effectively been *donated* to the project by team members or the university. Their estimated values are listed for transparency.

| Donated Resource | Source | Approx. Value | Notes |
|------------------|--------|---------------|-------|
| Personal development laptops (2 units) | Team members | ~$1,000–$1,500 each | Primary development machines |
| IDEs, OS licenses, productivity software | Pre-owned | ~$100–$200 | Includes VSCode, Windows/macOS licensing |
| Open-source backend software | Open source | $0 | Python, SQLAlchemy, etc. |
| Open-source frontend software | Open source | $0 | Expo, React Native, etc. |
| University resources | UC | $0 | library workspace, networking, printing (limited) |

## 3. Projected Expenses for Spring Semester

### 3.1 Cloud Hosting (Optional)
| Item | Est. Cost | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Cloud compute (AWS) | $5–$20/month | For hosting the backend + database |
| Object storage for images | $1–$5/month | For receipt images and user-uploaded food images |
| Domain name | ~$12/year | For demo deployment |

### 3.2 API / Data Costs (Optional)
| API Type | Est. Cost | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| OCR/Receipt Parsing API | $0–$15 (trial tier) | Used for M3 and M5 external integration tasks |
| Grocery/Store APIs | $0 | Mock adapters minimize cost |

### 3.3 Testing Resources
| Item | Est. Cost | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Cloud device/browser testing | $0–$10 | Student-tier availability; optional for UI validation |

### Estimated Total (Spring 2026)
**$20–$70 total projected cost** — entirely optional.  
NutriFlow can theoretically still be completed at **$0 additional cost** using free-tier services.

## 4. Budget Considerations Relative to Scope
NutriFlow’s design intentionally minimizes financial burden:

- Heavy reliance on open-source tooling  
- Lightweight, locally runnable ML components  
- Use of university-provided infrastructure  
- Development practices aligned with the constraints stated in Assignment #7  

The primary investment is **team labor**, documented through the Tasklist, Milestones, and Effort Matrix.

## 5. Conclusion
To date, NutriFlow has incurred **no expenses**, and projected future expenses remain minimal. The team anticipates completing the project without requiring external funding, relying primarily on open-source software, free cloud tiers, and university resources.
