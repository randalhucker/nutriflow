# Project Constraints Essay

NutriFlow’s design is bound first by economic realities: as a two‑person team with no outside financial support, funds for any necessary resources will be supplied personally until the need arises for significant funding (at which point we would pursue available grants/fundraising opportunities). This fact influences what design choices are available to us, encouraging us to prioritize open‑source tooling, develop custom store adapters, and use lightweight AI models to avoid API fees and steep cloud computing costs. It is possible that this project could result in a viable product, which would require investment in things like infrastructure scaling and marketing, but this is likely outside the scope of the capstone project itself.

There are various security/privacy concerns associated with storing sensitive user data that we will need to account for as well. For example, in order to take advantage of the Cart Management feature, users would need to provide NutriFlow with credentials to various grocery shopping websites. These credentials would need to be managed very carefully, as leaking them could result in bad actors gaining access to user profiles on other platforms that may contain payment information. One potential way to avoid this risk (that comes at the cost of convenience) is to repeatedly prompt the user for their credentials rather than store them. Similarly, data related to user’s purchase history and dietary preferences would likely be considered valuable to third parties, such as advertisers or insurance companies, and therefore requires strong safeguards. Clear privacy policies and consent mechanisms will be essential to building trust, since users should feel confident that their data is only being used to enhance their experience and not exploited for unintended purposes.

Legal and compliance obligations represent additional hurdles along the same vein. There are several established privacy frameworks such as the CCPA/CPRA and GDPR. These regulations emphasize principles including purpose limitation (data collected only for its stated use), data minimization (collecting no more than what is necessary), and user rights to access, export, correct, or delete their records. We will do our best to align NutriFlow with these standards so users are able to trust that our platform will protect their privacy. Additionally, any integration with grocery APIs must adhere to their terms of service, and third-party recipes or nutritional data will need to be properly attributed in accordance with licensing requirements. 

Finally, diversity, cultural, and social concerns are present, since the platform aims to support anyone pursuing a healthier lifestyle. The meal planner and search features will need to respect allergens, religious dietary restrictions, and cultural food traditions without reducing them to stereotypes. We plan to address this by supporting multiple ingredient aliases and providing flexibility in units (metric and imperial) to ensure cultural and geographic differences do not isolate certain user-groups. We can further reinforce inclusivity by presenting dietary suggestions in a neutral tone that avoids weight-loss-centric framing, to avoid alienating users who are vulnerable to disordered eating. In addition to promoting inclusivity, we will need to ensure that the recommendation system prioritizes nutritional integrity and clarity of purpose. Cost-saving suggestions are valuable, but they should not come at the cost of steering users toward nutritionally-inferior products. Likewise, all dietary guidance should be framed as general information rather than medical advice, so that no user is given the impression that NutriFlow is a substitute for professional care.

Overall, we seek to balance innovation with responsibility when it comes to NutriFlow’s design, offering practical tools for healthier living while ensuring that inclusivity, user trust, and privacy remain at the center of the experience.
