## Co-op and Other Related Experiences

### Cyber Engineering Intern, Cryptic Vector (4 semesters) - Liberty Township, Ohio
These descriptions are kept general to respect the sensitive nature of the projects on which I worked.

#### Rotation 1
- Conducted vulnerability research (VR) on an open-source software platform, including evaluating existing N-days.
- Successfully achieved arbitrary, remote code execution (RCE) by leveraging one such N-day in the test environment I established.
- Reverse engineered (RE'd) a proprietary embedded device (not meant to run custom/user code), with the goal to achieve arbitrary code execution; analyzed firmware/hardware.
- Created a MkDocs-based GitLab CI/CD pipeline to host project research documentation.

#### Rotation 2
- Employed QA testing methodologies within an internally developed framework to ensure the proper function of various accessors enabling intuitive control of complex devices.
- Detected, documented, and resolved bugs/inconsistencies through careful data validation and consideration of edge cases.
- Accelerated requirement completion through collaboration and careful prioritization; balanced current workload against backlog in an agile development environment.

#### Rotation 3
- Contributed to the development, testing, and maintenance of a full-stack diagramming tool designed to enable efficient and flexible visualization/planning of cyber operations.
- Led the design and implementation of 2 user-requested features to enhance the application.
- Iterated on an initial prototype for a backend diagram storage solution.

#### Rotation 4
- Assisted in debugging and optimization of a suite of custom pipelines and tools designed to facilitate the swift and secure transfer of code artifacts from low-side internet-connected environments to the high side.
- Co-led the addition of a new requestable resource type to respond to user demand.
