## Project Sought

For my capstone project, I am seeking to develop a platform that introduces a **novel way of delivering nutrition insights and food recommendations to users**. The project will combine **data engineering, AI/ML, and user-centric design** to help people make smarter food choices.

### Core Objectives

- **Automated Data Collection**  
  Scrape and aggregate nutrition facts, prices, and product availability from large grocery retailers to build a comprehensive database. (Web scraping, API integration, refreshes chronologically)

- **Personalized Food Intelligence**  
  Enable users to upload recipes, scan receipts, or take pictures of their pantries to automatically identify ingredients and nutritional content.

- **Meal & Shopping Recommendations**  
  Suggest balanced, cost-effective meal plans based on what users already have, while recommending additional ingredients at the cheapest prices across stores.

- **Smart Orchestration**  
  Provide integrated options to order groceries, schedule deliveries, and optimize food purchases for quality, price, and nutrition.

### Vision

The end goal is to create an **intelligent food ecosystem** that not only informs users about nutrition but also actively helps them **eat healthier, save money, and reduce food waste**. By bridging advanced AI capabilities with real-world food supply data, this project hopes to demonstrate measurable impact in personal wellness and accessibility to affordable nutrition.
